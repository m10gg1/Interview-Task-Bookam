A static  guide UI to test our Html and CSS skills.
My Implementation:
-Used Divs to separate the page into sections and work more efficiently. 
-Used Media Query to make the page flexible on all screens, with focus on the max-width to be Mobile Screen that is; 768px.
-Focused on using display element flexbox and it's parts for flexibility.
-To achieve the scroll horizontal Effect when the page reaches the maximum width, I used Over "display:"flex", "Over-flow:auto" and "flex-shrink:0;
-Using the "no wrap" attribute forces the pictures to be in a single row with no space when it reaches the max-width

Some of my challenges were implementing the Font Icons as seen on the "Home" Button and submitting late because of unforseen circumstances, and in conclusion this is very incomplete and can be completed If I am given the opportunity.
